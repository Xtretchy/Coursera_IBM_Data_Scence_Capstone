This model can help suggest safer roads to the user in case of emergencies or matters of urgency by predicting the occurrence of an accident on roads based on the weather of the day and conditions of the road."

    "3. Decision Tree\n",
    "4. K Nearest Neighbour\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* These models were used because the data was categorical. I also used Ordinal and Label Encoders from sklearn.preprocessing to map the categories to numbers as models can only be predicted based on relationship with numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Then, I used train_test_split from sklearn to split the encoded dataset into training and testing subsets so as to test for each of the model used.\n",
    "\n",
    "* While testing, I was able to determine the accuracy of each model tested and also the f1-score. \n",
    "\n",
    "* And out of these four models, the <b>k Nearest Neighbour (kNN)</b> model gave the highest accuracy and was further used on all of the data to improve its accuracy for prediction and also improve the probability of its outcome."
